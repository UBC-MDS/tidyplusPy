## About

The `tidyplusPy` package is an essential data cleaning package with features like **missing value treatment**, **data type cleansing** and displaying data as **markdown table** for documents. The package adds a few additional functionalities on the existing data wrangling packages (i.e. Pandas). The objective of this package is to provide a few specific functions to solve some of the pressing issues in data cleaning.


## Install and import

The package needs to be installed from GitHub. Open your Anaconda or Terminal, and type in:

```bash
# if you have git installed in your computer already, try:
pip install git+https://github.com/UBC-MDS/tidyplusPy.git

# if you do not have git installed, try:
pip install https://github.com/UBC-MDS/tidyplusPy/zipball/master
```

There are 5 functions, `typemix`, `cleanmix`, `EM`, `md` and `mmm`, in the package **tidyplusPy**. To import the package:
```Python
import tidyplusPy
```

## Functions included:
Three main parts including different functions in `tidyplusPy`
- **Data Type Cleansing** :
  - `typemix`
    * The function helps to find the columns containing different types of data, like character and numeric. The input of the function is a data frame, and the output of the function will be a list of 3 data frames reporting details about the mixture of data types. The first data frame in the list is the same as the input data frame, the second one tells you the location and types of data in the columns where there is type mixture. The third data frame is a summary of the second data frame.

  - `cleanmix`
    * The function helps to clean our data frame. After knowing where the mixture of data types is, one can use this function to keep/delete a type of data in certain columns. Here, the input will be an output by the `typemix` function, ID of the column(s) (the ID is the numbering of the column(s)) that they want to clean, the type of data they want to work on, and if they want to keep or delete the certain type. The output will be a data frame like the original one but with specified data type in the certain columns deleted.

- **Missing Value Treatment** : Basic Imputation and EM Imputation -`em` and  `mmm`
    * Basic Imputation: function used `mmm` replace missing values in a column of a dataframe, or multiple columns of dataframe based on the `method` of imputation

      - (Method = 'Mean') replace using mean
      - (Method = 'Median') replace using median
      - (Method = 'Mode') replace using mode
    * EM Imputation: **Bonus** function used `em` (method = "EM")
      - Uses EM(Expectation- Maximization) algorithm to predict the closest value to the missing value
      - Can be used for both numeric and categorical predictions
- **Markdown Table**:
  - `md_new()`: This function creates a bare bone for generating a markdown.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

#### Data type cleansing with typemix

```Python
# prepare data frame
import pandas as pd
from tidyplusPy.typemix import typemix

d={'x1':[1,2,3,"1.2.3"],
   'x2':["test","test",1,True],
   'x3':[True,True,False,False]}
dat=pd.DataFrame(data=d)

# run the function
typemix(dat)

```

#### Data type cleansing with cleanmix

```Python
# prepare data frame
import pandas as pd
from tidyplusPy.typemix import typemix
from tidyplusPy.cleanmix improt cleanmix

d={'x1':[1,2,3,"1.2.3"],
   'x2':["test","test",1,True],
   'x3':[True,True,False,False]}
dat=pd.DataFrame(data=d)
result=typemix(dat) # need result from typemix function as input

# run the function
cleanmix(result,column=c(1,2),type=c("number","character"))
```

#### Imputation with mean/ median / mode

* Works on pandas dataframe

```Python
from tidyplusPy import mmm as tm

NaN = float('nan')
ID = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
A = [NaN, NaN, NaN, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4]
B = [0.2, NaN, 0.2, 0.7, 0.9, NaN, NaN]
C = [NaN, 'A', 'B', NaN, 'C', 'D', 'D']
D = [NaN, 'C', 'E', NaN, 'C', 'H', 'D']
columns = {'A':A, 'B':B, 'C':C, 'D':D}
df = pd.DataFrame(columns, index=ID)
df.index.name = 'ID'


tm.mmm(df,method = "mode") ### method can be changed to mean and median as well
```

#### Imputation with EM

* Works on ONLY on nd-array for now

```Python
from tidyplusPy import EM as te

matrix= np.random.rand(5,4)
matrix[1,0] = np.nan
matrix[2,1] = np.nan
matrix[4,2] = np.nan
matrix[3,3] = np.nan

te.em(matrix)
```

#### Create empty markdown table

```Python
from tidyplusPy import md

tbl1 = md.md_new()
# print out the table in markdown syntax
print(tbl1)

# create table of size 3x3; alignment to center
tbl2 = md.md_new(nrow = 3, ncol = 3, align = "c")
print(tbl2)

# provide header
tbl3 = md.md_new(header = ["foo","boo"])
print(tbl3)
```

## User Scenario

Using Data Manipulation functionalities

  * Users can use the package when they want to clean and wrangle their data. For example, if the data has not been cleaned yet, users can use function `typemix` to check where data is not clean and use `cleanmix` to clean data. Based on personal work experience, the mix of number and character is usually seen in the data collected from the survey. After clean data is ready, one can use the `Missing Value Treatment` to deal with missing data by EM algorithm. You can use `md_new()` to create a empty markdown table.


## Existing features in Python ecosystem similar to `tidyplusPy`

* Data Type Cleansing
  - [Pandas:string processing](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#string-regular-expression-replacement) function and [Pandas:string processing](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#string-regular-expression-replacement). [Brief Version](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Pandas_Cheat_Sheet_2.pdf) The existing pandas version doesn't have a functionality to explicitly perform string processing/datatype conversion without affecting the overall column type (which is inconvenient when you have really messed up data with mix of strings and numbers)
* Missing Value treatment
  - Python doesn't have imputation methods which use `EM algorithm` for missing value treatment, which in fact is very efficient and accurate [Imputation methods in python](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html#sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer)
* Markdown table in Python
  * Python doesn't have a package or library which can output a dataset in the form of a markdown table (User defined)
